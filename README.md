### What is Seq?

Seq is a log server designed to speed up diagnostics in complex, asynchronous and distrubuted applications. It has a strong focus on _structured logging_, the idea that log events should carry important information in first-class properties.

### Documentation and support

The Seq [online documentation](http://docs.getseq.net) has information on all aspects of Seq - it's a great place to start if you are configuring or using Seq for the first time.

If you need help with [Serilog.Sinks.Seq](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-seq), the [Troubleshooting section](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-seq#troubleshooting) of the sink documentation has some useful steps for tracking down common issues.

For more information or help with Seq, please feel free to visit our [support forum](http://docs.getseq.net/discuss) or email **support@getseq.net**.
