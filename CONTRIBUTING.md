# Contributing to `seq-tickets`

Welcome to the hub for issues, design discussions and the feature roadmap for [Seq](https://getseq.net). More information about this repository can be found in the [README](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets).

### Reporting a bug

If you think you may have found a bug in Seq, this is the place to report it. You can **[search existing issues](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/issues)** or **[raise a new issue](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/issues/new)** here.

When reporting a bug, please provide as much information as you can about the Seq version you are using and the environment it's running in.

Recent Seq versions provide a downloadable diagnostic report in _Settings > Diagnostics_; we don't recommend attaching the entire report here (it may contain sensitive information), but in most cases system information such as hardware/software configuration can be conveniently copied from it.

### Suggesting a new feature

To propose a feature, please [create an issue](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/issues/new) to discuss it with the Seq development team and community.
